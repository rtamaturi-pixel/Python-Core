# Python Core – Learning Journey

This repository documents my practical learning of Core Python concepts using Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda environment.  
It includes daily exercises, examples, and notes created while exploring Python fundamentals — from the basics to object-oriented programming and file handling.

### 2. Data Types and Data Structures
- Understanding variables and data types  
- Using operators for computation and logic  
- Working with strings, lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries  

### 3. Control Flow and Conditional Statements
- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Using comparison and logical operators  
- Loops: `for`, `while`, and nested loops  
- Control keywords: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`  
- Understanding the `range()` function  

### 4. Functions and Modules
- Defining and calling functions  
- Function arguments, return values, and scope  
- Lambda, map, and filter functions  
- Writing nested and higher-order functions  
- Importing and using modules  
- Common Python modules used:
  - `math`
  - `random`
  - `datetime`
  - `os`  
- Understanding namespace, `help()`, and `dir()`  

### 5. Classes and Objects (OOP)
- Creating classes and objects  
- Understanding the `__init__()` method and `self` parameter  
- Instance, class, and static properties  
- Modifying and deleting object attributes  
- Core OOP principles:
  - Inheritance  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Polymorphism  
  - Abstraction  
- Exploring multiple dispatch and abstract base classes  

### 6. File Handling
- Creating, reading, and writing files  
- Performing operations on files  
- Handling errors and exceptions
